# Introduction

Welcome to the Skydel plug-ins documentation!

Do you have a feature request for Skydel? Are you thinking you can do the work yourself? We are here for you; teaming up with Skydel has never been easier! With the addition of the new plug-in framework, users can now develop features and integrate them into the Skydel user interface and real-time simulation engine, to allow for customization and collaboration that can accommodate each specific user's needs.

How can you begin working on your Skydel plug-in? The first step is to follow the instructions on how to setup the development environment on either [Ubuntu](development-environment/ubuntu-18.md) or [Windows](development-environment/windows-10.md).

Are you having trouble figuring out how plug-ins are integrated in Skydel? This [page ](plug-ins-in-skydel/using-plugins.md)explains it all.
