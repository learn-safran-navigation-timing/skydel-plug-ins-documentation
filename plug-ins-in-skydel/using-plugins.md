# Using Plug-ins

## What is a plug-in for Skydel?

A plug-in is a shared library \(_.so_ or _.dll_\) that implements some of the interfaces of the Skydel Plug-in SDK.

## How to make a plug-in available in Skydel?

Make sure you copy the plug-in \(_.so_ or _.dll_ file\) into the _Skydel Data Folder / Plug-ins._ When Skydel is launched, it will search that folder in order to list all the available plug-ins.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The search is only done at the launch of Skydel. Creating a new configuration won't trigger a search for new plug-ins
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}

## Can a plug-in be instantiated multiple time?

Yes, a plug-in can be instantiated multiple time since all plug-in instances are independent.
